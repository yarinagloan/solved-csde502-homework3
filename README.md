<strong>Instructions:  </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Create an R Markdown Rmd file and render it to a self-contained HTML file. Use the output format <strong>bookdown::html_document2</strong> in the YAML header so you can use various methods of cross referencing. Feel free to use any of the code examples provided or any other resources at your disposal.</li>

 <li>Upload both the Rmd and HTML files to the course Canvas site (<a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1434040">https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1434040</a><a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1434040">)</a>. Upload two separate files rather than creating a zip file.</li>

<strong>Explanation: </strong>

This assignment is designed to integrate knowledge from previous lessons to create an informative, easy-toread, transparent, and reproducible document.




<strong>Guidelines: </strong>

Using the Add Health data set that was introduced in the lesson for week 2

<a href="https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/week2.html#tidyverse">(</a><a href="https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/week2.html#tidyverse">http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/week2.html#tidyverse</a><a href="https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/week2.html#tidyverse">)</a>, create an HTML document that does some exploratory data analysis.




It is not necessary to perform any major analysis â€¦ we will get into more data manipulation, recoding, etc. later in the term.




Make sure your document includes at least the following:




<ol>

 <li>Your name and contact information</li>

 <li>Date of creation</li>

 <li>A table of contents</li>

 <li>Sequentially numbered section headers</li>

 <li>At least one figure with a caption</li>

 <li>At least one table with a caption</li>

 <li>At least one LaTeX-generated equation with an equation number</li>

 <li>Code-generated cross-references within the text to the figure, table, and equation (use any of the crossreferencing methods presented in the lesson)</li>

 <li>At least one citation and a bibliography (note: BibTeX formatted reference data can be exported from EndNote, Mendeley, and Zotero)</li>

 <li>Source code at the end of the document as shown in previous examples</li>

</ol>
